Firstly we need to import the numpy.
syntax: import numpy as np
Here, import is a keyword to import any library, numpy is the library name, and type "as" and declare any variable name (like shorter then numpy).
why shorter then numpy?
because purpose of that variable is if we want to use any attribute in numpy library then we do this:
numpy.array(), we need to type always numpy. because choose any variable shorter then numpy(preferred np).
How to create an array in numpy?
Syntax: np.array([1,2,3,4]);
Note: Above array is 1D array.you declare multi-dimension array tooo.
How to know the type of array?
syntax: type(array_variable_name);
What is shape?
shape is nothing but a tuple contains number of rows and number of columns like (2,3).
if array is more then 2D, then shape is like (2,3,3).
if it is 1D then it will shows only columns like (3,);
